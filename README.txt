🚇 SDG 11: Public Transport Optimization Using Machine Learning

📖 Project Overview
This project addresses Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by leveraging machine learning to optimize public transport systems. Using clustering algorithms and predictive modeling, we analyze urban areas to provide data-driven recommendations for route optimization, reduced environmental impact, and improved accessibility.
